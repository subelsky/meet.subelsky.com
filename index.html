<h2 class="row">Where?</h2>

<p class="row">
I am usually in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2400+boston+st,+21224&hl=en&t=h&z=16">Canton neighborhood</a> of Baltimore about 
once a week, typically on Mondays. Otherwise I am working out of my home office in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=21218&hl=en&sll=39.281325,-76.581074&sspn=0.010514,0.022724&t=h&z=13">Charles Village</a>.
</p>

<p class="row">Here is where I prefer to meet in Charles Village in descending order of preference:</p>
<ul class="row">
  <li>Walking or jogging around the neighborhood (starting at my house and walking up the Greenway through the beautiful Guilford neighborhood)</li>
  <li>Walking around the <a href="http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/sculpture.html">BMA sculpture garden</a></li>
  <li>Lunch or coffee at <a href="http://donnas.com/charlesvillage/">Donna's</a></li>
  <li>Lunch or beer at <a href="http://www.cvptowson.com/down.htm">Charles Village Pub</a></li>
  <li>Lunch at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/petes-grille-baltimore">Pete's Grill</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="row">When?</h2>

<p class="row">
If you are up for a walk or a jog my schedule is very flexible as I do those things almost every weekday. I don't run fast;
I just want to get my heart rate elevated. I also walk and run in all seasons and weather conditions. You can also just talk 
to me over the phone while I run. If either of these options work for you please <a href="mailto:mike@subelsky.com">email me</a> 
one or two days in advance and we can lock down a particular time.
</p>

<p class="row">
If you would like to have a stationary, indoors meeting, that's totally fine also. Please pick a time from the below calendar. I try
to keep it updated for the upcoming 2-3 weeks.
